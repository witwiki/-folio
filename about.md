My name is Vikram Udyawer. I grew up in four different countries as a child (Dubai-U.A.E.; Bangalore-India; Napier-New Zealand and Sydney-Australia). I have a pretty international background and up-bringing. It's one of my true strengths as, for the most part, I have a view point from other cultures in scenarios ranging from everyday life to geopolitical incidents. It's also the reason why I believe travelling doesn't make people open-minded but rather living in other countries is better at that. This is because you see a nation's culture through their everyday experiences. As a traveller you generally don't because you're on a holiday. I'm also a proponent of a one Earth government since, nation borders change everyday.

I've had a pretty diverse professional background in healthcare, astronautics and more recently artificial intelligence. I'm a dreamer by nature and hence, using my analytical ability I am currently working on my startup. Working to create a company works toward my true strengths as an architect (tech + non-tech), strategist (tech + non-tech) and hopefully a good leader too - hence, the dreamer.

My professional interests are broad and generally specific to the application of these broad interests into society. Hence, the choice to move toward a life of entreprendre. What I care about? My planet, the people on it and outer space exploration. Everything I do, I do to try and  serve those three in some form. I am particularly interested in the idea of identify and its ownership because it relates to four aspects I've mentioned above: (1) my international up-bringing, (2) my planet, (3) the people on it and (4) outer space exploration.

My interests outside the above are in art, small tech projects, hiking, music (my EP/XP on soundcloud), investing (in people), travel, kayaking, beaches, and scify movies/tv. I love hanging out with my dog Holly and cat Coco whenever I'm home for the holidays.
