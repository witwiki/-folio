My name is Vikram Udyawer. I grew up in four different countries as a child. I have a pretty international background and up-bringing. It's one of my true strengths. I'm a proponent of a one Earth government since, nation borders change everyday.

I've had a pretty diverse professional background in healthcare, astronautics and more recently artificial intelligence. If you're some who's interested in qualifications then, I have degrees in medical tech, finance, aerospace and information sciences. I have other qualifications through MOOCs and certifications. Please refer to my first post "an introduction about me" for more detail about me.

My interests outside the above are in art, small tech projects, hiking, music (my EP/XP on soundcloud), investing (in people), travel, kayaking, beaches, and scify movies/tv. I love hanging out with my dog Holly and cat Coco whenever I'm home for the holidays.
